# Christocoin
Chrsitocoin is the peer to peer buying and selling tokens for the Christians and the Church. It has become necessary to create a new coin for the use of the church and the entire body of Christ based on the principles of the Holy Scriptures. In Joel 1:5 the Lord God accused the nations of taken His silver and His gold which He promised to restore back. Chrsitocoin is a digital token that seeks a global platform for the restoration of God's silver and Gold to the people of God in the end time. What happens when the Anti-christ takes over the world political and economic power and controls everything? The purchasing asset and purchasing power of the church will be limited. This will be the  purchasing power of an uncompromising church.
